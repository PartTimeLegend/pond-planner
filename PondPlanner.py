        This method returns the internal fish type keys used by the system, which
        can be used with add_fish, remove_fish, and other fish-related methods.

        Returns:
            List[str]: A sorted list of fish type identifiers (keys) from the fish database.
                      These are typically lowercase, underscore-separated strings.

        Raises:
            RuntimeError: If the fish database is inaccessible or corrupted.

        Note:
            - Returns internal fish type keys, not display names
            - Use fish_database property to get full fish information including display names
            - Fish type keys are case-insensitive when used in other methods
            - List is sorted alphabetically for consistent ordering

        Generate a comprehensive pond planning report with specifications, analysis, and recommendations.

        This method creates a detailed text report that includes pond dimensions, current fish
        stock, stocking analysis with bioload calculations, equipment sizing recommendations,
        and maximum stocking guidelines. The report provides all information needed for
        pond planning and equipment purchasing decisions.

        Returns:
            str: A formatted multi-line string containing the complete pond planning report.
                Returns an error message if pond dimensions are not set or if report
                generation fails due to data issues.

            No exceptions are raised - errors are captured and returned as error messages

            - Includes pond specifications, fish stock, stocking analysis, and equipment recommendations
            - Provides both current status and maximum capacity information
            - Equipment recommendations scale with pond volume and current bioload
            - Report format is designed for both screen display and printing

            - Pond specifications (dimensions, shape, volume)
